# Recipies

The following are all of my completely original recipies, made from a mixture of family recipies as well as experimentation over the years. I admit I'm not the greatest at keeping track of how much I truly use, I just can tell by looking and tasting when it has too much or too little.
The main reason why these recipies are out here is that there were not enough that I could find online. I wanted mushroom and dandelion recipies and all I got was soup. I got fed up with searching and started messing around. Somewhere along the line I got it!
Plus, it's *really* easy to lose track of recipies scratched down on pieces of paper.
Family recipies are noted in brackets next to the title, everything else is all-original.
Hopefully you can try these recipies out and enjoy them!
