<p>I’ve worked on a variety of software projects for personal, professional, and public projects! I’ve done volunteer and professional website work utilizing HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. Currently I’m focusing on creating dynamic PHP engines and improving my web design by becoming more responsive with my designs and less bloated! Website optimization is a must and I’m constantly working towards self-improvement with my designs!</p>

<p>Software development and music are just the tips of the iceburg, as I am an artist at my core! It takes artistic abilities to design software and write music. Naturally, I expand my skills into the areas of graphic design, photography, and typography!</p>
